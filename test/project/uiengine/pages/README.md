Welcome! This is the UIengine Sample Project.
It contains some sample pages to showcase and also test the basic functionality provided by the UIengine.

You can use this project as an overview to look at certain features, like [documentation written in markdown](/documentation/getting-started/) or the [design token templates](/documentation/tokens/colors/).

The sample project pattern styles are provided by [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
This is just to make them look a bit nicer and give you an idea of how to integrate assets in the templates.

Please ignore the "Test Cases" part, as it only contains some pages that exist for testing.
