# Test Cases

These are just some pages that exclusively exist for testing.
Nothing to see here, move along :)

## Code blocks

This is `inline code`.

Here is indented code block:

    var test = true;

And this is a fenced code block with syntax highlighting:

```js
var test = true;
```

That's it.
